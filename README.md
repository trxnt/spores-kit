# Setting Up

To get started, clone the repo onto your computer and go to the directory and run:
### `yarn install`
### `npm start`


# Usage

The App.js file shows examples of how to use the Spores Kit. The SporesEmbed
component lets you pass in a main song URL, an alternate song URL, skin (image),
and juice samples (a list of additional loops).

### `<SporeEmbed color="blue" main={mainSongURL} alternate={alternateSongURL} juiceSamples={juiceSamples} skin={skin}/> `
